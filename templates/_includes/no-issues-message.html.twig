    <p class="lead">We are working to complete the digitization of the print archive to a digital format. Most issues of <em>The Volette</em> and <em>The Pacer</em> up through 2000 are stored on microfilm at the UT Martin Paul Meek Library. The remaining copies are in their original newsprint and will need to be scanned.</p>
    <p class="lead">Review our <a href="{{ path('missing_issues') }}">list of missing issues</a> for any that we have been unable to locate on microfilm.</p>
    <p class="lead">If you have any issues of the newspaper not found on this website that you would like to donate to the cause, contact us at <a href="mailto:archives@thepacer.org">archives@thepacer.org</a>.</p>
